	<h1>Come visit the Ellora Caves!</h1>
		<p>The Ellora Caves are located in the Aurangabad District of Maharashtra, India and are one of the largest rock-cut monastery-temple cave complexes in the world, featuring Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monuments, and artwork, dating from the 600-1000 CE period. All of the Ellora monuments were built during Hindu dynasties such as the Rashtrakuta dynasty, which constructed part of the Hindu & Buddhist caves, and the Yadava dynasty, which constructed a number of the Jain caves. 
		Funding for the construction of the monuments was provided by royals, traders and the wealthy of the region. There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which are open to public. These consist of 12 Buddhist, 17 Hindu, and 5 Jain caves, with each group representing deities and mythologies that were prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as monasteries of each respective religion. 
		They were built in proximity to one another and illustrate the religious harmony that existed in ancient India.</p>

			<h4>Outstanding!</h4>
				<q>One of the great sights of India, the caves are not to be missed, for their historical value, sheer beauty and the astonishing quality of the carvings, especially Kailasha temple. The grounds are well kept, it's not so far from Aurangabad, and was a highlight of our trip to India.</q>
			<h4>Awesome!</h4>
				<q>Fabulous ancient caves carved out of the hillside by Jains, Buddhists and Hindus. You need a good guide to get the most out of the visit.</q>
			<h4>Must Visit!!</h4>
				<q>Loved every bit of the experience of the visit. it starts from Kailasha temple and the on left side (walk about 50 mtrs) is the Jain temple caves and on the right side approx 70 mtrs walk are Buddhist caves. Absolute delight and you cant stop marvelling at the construction that was done nearly 1500 years back!! Incredible India!!</q>
