	<main>
		<p> Goldendoodles are the result of breeding Golden retrievers and poodles, and are one of the most popular mixed dog breeds. 
		This is not without good reason, as these dogs make incredibly charming and fun companions that are easily trained. 
		They require only an average amount of exercise, are nonshedding and generally nonnoisy, and can get along with strangers and other animals, 
		which makes them ideal for both country and city living.</p>
		
		<p>However, this dog breed shouldn't be pent up in an apartment or kept outside, because goldendoodles are very social and prefer 
		to spend time in the house with their owners. Their fur also never stops growing, which can be a hassle when it comes to grooming. 
		Seperation anxiety can also be an issue with his breed. But the good qualities certainly outweigh the bad, which makes this dog breed a great fit for all types of pet owners. </p>
