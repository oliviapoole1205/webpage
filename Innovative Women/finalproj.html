        <img class="bio1" src="photo1.jpg" alt="an image of Gertrude B. Elion." />
        	<p>Gertrude Elion was born in New York. When, as a teenager, she watched her maternal grandfather die of cancer, she decided to devote her life to fighting the disease. 
        She studied chemistry at Hunter College and New York University, but, as a woman, had difficulty finding work as a chemist. During World War II a lack of chemists arose 
        because many men had joined the war, which led Gertrude Elion to find work at a laboratory. In the mid-1940s she moved to Burroughs Wellcome's research laboratory, now <a href="https://www.gsk.com/" target="_blank">GlaxoSmithKline</a>, 
        where she remained until her death.</p>
       		<p>Gertrude Elion's research revolutionized both the development of new pharmaceuticals and the field of medicine in general. Previously, pharmaceuticals had primarily 
        been produced from natural substances. During the 1950s, Gertrude Elion, together with <!--used target blank to make the link appaer as words that were in the paragraph--><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._HitchingsGeorge" target="_blank">George Hitchings</a>, developed a systematic method for producing drugs based on 
        knowledge of biochemistry and diseases. One of the first drugs produced by the pair was for leukemia and helped many children with the disease to survive. Other drugs 
        they created have been used to fight malaria, infections, and gout, as well as help with organ transplantations.</p>
        <p>In 1988 Elion received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Hitchings and Sir James Black for discoveries of "important new principles of drug 
        treatment". She was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1990, a member of the Institute of Medicine in 1991 and a Fellow of the American 
        Academy of Arts and Sciences also in 1991. Awards include the Garvan-Olin Medal (1968), the National Medal of Science (1991), and the Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement 
        Award (1997). In 1991 Elion became the first woman to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1992, she was elected to the Engineering and Science Hall 
        of Fame. She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1995.
