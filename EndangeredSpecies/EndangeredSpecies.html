<h1>What Exactly is a Vaquita?</h1>
<p>Vaquita, the world’s most rare marine mammal, is on the edge of extinction. This little porpoise wasn't discovered until 1958 and a little over 
half a century later, we are on the brink of losing them forever.The vaquita has a large dark ring around its eyes and dark patches on its lips that 
form a thin line from the mouth to the pectoral fins. Its dorsal surface is dark gray, sides pale gray and ventral surface white with long, light gray 
markings. Newborn vaquita have darker coloration and a wide gray fringe of color that runs from the head to the dorsal flukes, passing through the dorsal 
and pectoral fins. They are most often found close to shore in the Gulf's shallow waters, although they quickly swim away if a boat approaches. </p>

<h1>Why The Vaquita Matters</h1>
<p>The vaquita is the most endangered cetacean in the world. With as few as 30 left, the species will become extinct without a fully enforced gillnet ban 
throughout their entire range.Efforts are urgently being made to ensure they can live and thrive in their natural habitat. The vaquita will be extinct,
 possibly by 2018, if fishery bycatch is not eliminated immediately. Nearly one out of every five vaquita get entangled and drown in gillnets intended 
 for other marine species  Entanglement in gillnets was the primary cause that brought the vaquita to low levels by the mid-1970s. </p>

<h1>Conservation</h1>
<p>Conservation efforts on behalf of the vaquita are being made by an international collaboration of conservation scientists, animal care specialists and marine mammal 
veterinarians to save the animal through initiatives from organizations the World Wildlife Foundation and the Marine Mammal Center. These organizations are working 
towards gillnet removal, and are helping raise awareness about the vaquita and the threats to its survival, supporting development of alternative fishing gear, and 
providing administrative support for initiatives such as population surveys. </p>
<p>In July 2016, President Barack Obama and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico announced billateral collaboration measures to protect the vaquita. As a follow up 
to this meeting and to the recommendations CIRVA presented in its vaquita report, Mexico's National Institute of Fisheries (INAPESCA) and WWF Mexico established an international 
committee of experts to further develop and urgently implement vaquita-safe fishing technologies.This independent committee has been charged with improving existing vaquita-safe 
fishing technologies (such as the small trawl to catch shrimp and traps and other gear for fish) to substitute gillnets which will be permanently prohibited starting September 
in the Upper Gulf of California, the only place on Earth where the vaquita exists.A protocol and guidelines to catch shrimp with vaquita-safe technology is expected to be ready soon. </p>
